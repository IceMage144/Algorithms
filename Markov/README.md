## Markov

### Purpose

Explore how cohesive can be a text created only using Markov chain.

### What it does

The program takes a text file, and generate a new text file with a randomly
generated text, based at the structure of the input text.

### How to use

Choose an input file and the number of words that the output file should contain,
then run `python markov.py <input file> <number of words>`, so the program will
print out the generated text.
