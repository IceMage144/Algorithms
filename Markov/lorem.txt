Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the rhymes
He asked Will I see heaven in mine?

That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh they say you could see your future,
Inside a glass of water
With riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh Oh Oh

Ah Son, dont ask,
Neither how full nor empty
is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on the wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions said and past
In figurines and leaders
saying nothing at all
And he chimed stars in heaven aligned
Oh Oh Oh

Ah Son, dont ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

What are we drinking when were done?
Glasses of water...

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Sacrifice me for my sins
For my beliefs, spit at me, die with me
When I'm gone, death will come to you
Death will come
Sacrifice me for my sins

Sacrifice her life to fire

The flames went high to lick the skin on her chin
The words she said for those words she would die
The crowd circles around her, praising their merciful god
Her screams got weaker heathen, heathen, the mass was shouting
The children that once were loving, now their small hands were full of rocks

They found her bleeding
The dark night came creeping
Was she one of the devil's own kind?
Beyond belief, beyond the pain
And grief, I lay low
And crawl deep, choosing the narrow path

Fear your thoughts and let the father judge them
Walk the shining path and guide the weakling along
The crowd circles around her, praising their merciful god
Their screams grew higher: heathen, heathen the mass was shouting
Hunt down the profane and put them to the torch

Burn me on the fire
Call me liar, shout at me, cry for me
When I'm gone, death will come to me
Death will come
Burn me on the fire

All winter we got carried
Away over on the rooftops. Let's get married.
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry.

And don't worry.

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end;
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge;
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends.

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making our escape.

could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
'cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along

And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know the names or our faces
But they will carry on for us

Oh, it's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until...

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

It's too cold
For you here and now
Let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Did you stand there all alone?
Oh I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out, somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

I'm just the shadow of a bigger man
Glowing brighter with each year I am
I was standing on a mountain
Just looking down (on you on you)

It's like my daddy said
You gotta use your head (my body won't work for nobody but me, son)
Yeah, no one said that I aim to please

All your light can't save me
All your light all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come (my body won't work for nobody but me, son)

As a boy I had it figured out
There are things that you can't live without
But money, it's sad but true, would surely top that list
And your rules your rules, well they would not be missed

Well I became
Whole again
Cause no one said no one said no one said
There'd be times like these

I said all your light can't save me
All your light all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come

(my body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these

I was licking flames, when I broke your reins
Still, no one said no one said no one said it'd be suicide

Well I’m so above you
And it’s plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I don’t mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting

Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you
And I should’ve done you just the same
But I came to love you
Am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waiting

Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
I’m a lonely boy

"What a beautiful wedding! What a beautiful wedding," says a bridesmaid to the waiter,
"And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore."

Oh, well, in fact,
Well, I'll look at it this way,
I mean technically our marriage is saved,
Well, this calls for a toast.
So, pour the champagne.

I chime in with a
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality.

I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'
I spend too much time explainin' myself
I hope there's some time to change it

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
That you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me baby
Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute
When I'm with you breathing

The Sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder
I can't wait 'til the drought is over

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's just what I'll do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

We need to cry
And if we do, I know that would be alright
