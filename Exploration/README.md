## Exploration

### Purpose

Some programs for exploring math or making mathematical things

### What it does

There are various programs:
* *CyclicNumbers* - Given a number "n", this program finds if 1/n has period length
of n-1 ([bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_number#Relation_to_repeating_decimals))
* *JacobiMethod* - This program uses the Jacobi method to find the solution of a
diagolnally dominant system of linear equations
([bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method))
* *KhinchinConstants* - This program finds the Khinchin's constants
([bibliography](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KhinchinHarmonicMean.html))
* *PrimeEcho* - This was made just to explore how close from the truth

* *SumOfSquares* - Finds prime numbers using the sum of two squares

### How to use

* *CyclicNumbers* - Run `make cn` at a command line to generate an executable.
Execute it, input a number and let it check if it's cyclic or not
* *JacobiMethod* - Run `python JacobiMethod.py` at the command line and follow the
instructions
* *KhinchinConstants* - Run `make kc` at the command line to generate an executable.
Execute it and input some informations about what you want.
* *PrimeEcho* - Run `make pe` at the command line to generate an executable.
Execute it to see some stats.
* *SumOfSquares* - Run `make ss` at the command line to generate an executable.
Execute it, input some informations and it will print the numbers of the form
a^2 + b^2, where the parity of "a" and "b" are different.
