## Bouncing Balls

![Bouncing balls print](/bouncing_balls.png)

### Purpose

Made to practice implementation of physics, after seeing some physics at a
[MAC0209 (Modeling and simulating)](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0209) class.

### What it does

This program simulates the physics of two balls and a "black hole". I implemented
collision between two balls, between a ball and the wall, gravitational force,
buoyancy force and air resistence.

Depending on your computer processor, the fps can be a lot slower than at my
computer. This was something I didn't noticed when I made this.

### How to use

Make sure you have SFML installed. An executable file can be generated running
`make exec` at the command line. Click on the screen to spawn a black hole.
