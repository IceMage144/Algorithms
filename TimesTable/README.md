## TimesTable

### What it does

The program generates a circular representation of a [times table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table)
of some number. To do this, first we choose a number "x" (that is called factor
by the program) and a number "m" (that is called modulus by the program),
so we draw a circle with "m" evenlly spaced points at its circumference,
labled from 0 to m-1, then we connect the point "y" with the point "z" if
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=y*x&space;\equiv&space;z&space;\mod&space;m" target="\_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y*x&space;\equiv&space;z&space;\mod&space;m" title="y*x \equiv z \mod m" /></a>

### How to use

Execute the program through a command line using `python timesTable.py`, then
follow the instructions.
