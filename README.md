## Algoritmos

**Purpose**

In this folder I put programs made by me, for fun or with the purpose of
practicing the algorithms learned in classes.

**Folders**

* BouncingBalls - Simulates some balls with physics. Made using C++ with SFML library.

* Collatz - Analizes the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). Made using python.
* Evo - A genetic algorithm to select the best fighter circlet. Made using Python with PyGame library.
* Exploration - Algorithms to explore math.
* GraphicalLib - Graphical library for generating simple .pgm images. Made using C++.
