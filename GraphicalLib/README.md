## Graphical library

### Purpose

This was made with the purpose of practicing C++ object-oriented programming,
at my [MAC0216 (Programming lab I)](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0216)
classes.

### What it does

With this library you can generate an black-and-white image that could contain
circles, ellipsis, regular and irregular polygons and lines.

### How to use

There are some comments at the files that explain how to use it. An executable
can make using the command `make test` at the command line.

### Credits

This library was made partially by my teacher, Fernando MÃ¡rio de Oliveira Filho,
partially by me and partially by my fiends.
